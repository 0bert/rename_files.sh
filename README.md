WHAT THIS SCRIPT CAN DO AND HOW IT CAN BE USED!

This script takes a list of file names as input and renames them to append the current date and time to the file name. 
This can be useful for creating backups or versioning files.
To use this script, save it to a file (e.g., renamIing_files.sh) and make it executable with the command chmod +x renaming_files.sh. 
Then, you can run the script with a list of file names as arguments, like this, for example:
                         
			 ./renaming_files.sh doc1.txt xyz2.jpg edu3.png
			 
			 Substitude doc1.txt xyz2.jpg edu3.png with names of your own files.
